# astro_UFS
A collection of Unsupervised Feature Selection algorithms for use within astronomy


Currently this github is still under construction. In the coming week, python algorithms for PFA, LS-WNCH-SR, LS-WNCH-BE, database construction, EIF filtered databases and more will be added to github. These will be provided with documentation and dependencies listed, and are meant as a starting step for other people who wish to implement these techniques upon their own research. 

A following step will be the construction of an python module that can be installed with a pip command. 

In the end however, this is simply part of a bachelor thesis within Astronomy.
